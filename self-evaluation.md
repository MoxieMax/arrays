1. How confident do you feel with the content on Arrays so far?
  * Fairly confident, but not fully. I understand the concept, and I understand the basics of filling arrays.
1. Is there any additional learning you need or want to do before moving to the next lesson?
  * I don't think so at the moment, but I'm excited to see what else they can be used for and how they can be applied to real world scenarios.
1. What questions do you have about Arrays?
  * Why do they start on 0 instead of 1?
  * Can you select a specific element to be removed by index position?
  * Can you add an item to a specific index position?
  * Can you have the arrays print in a specific order (alphabetic, numerical, random) if they're not added to the array in that order?
